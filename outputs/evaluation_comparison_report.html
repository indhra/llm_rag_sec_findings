The question asks for the total amount of term debt (current + non-current) reported by Apple as of September 28, 2024.

## Locate
The relevant information is found in context chunk #1 and #4.

## Extract
From context chunk #1, we have the current and non-current term debt:
$
(13,505) $
(18,247)

From context chunk #4, we have the total term debt and its non-current portion:
$
96,662
$
85,750

## Calculate
To find the total term debt, we need to add the current and non-current portions. However, the current portion is negative, so we need to subtract it from the non-current portion.

Step 1: Non-current portion = $85,750
Step 2: Current portion = -$13,505
Step 3: Total term debt = Non-current portion + Current portion = $85,750 - $13,505 = $72,245

However, we also have the total term debt from context chunk #4, which is $96,662. We need to reconcile this with our calculation.

## Synthesize
Since the total term debt from context chunk #4 is $96,662, and our calculation resulted in $72,245, we need to find the current portion of term debt to reconcile the difference.

From context chunk #4, we have the total term debt and its non-current portion:
$
96,662
$
85,750

We can set up an equation to find the current portion:
Total term debt = Non-current portion + Current portion
$96,662 = $85,750 + Current portion

Step 1: Current portion = Total term debt - Non-current portion
Step 2: Current portion = $96,662 - $85,750
Step 3: Current portion = $10,912

Now we can find the total term debt by adding the current and non-current portions:
Total term debt = Current portion + Non-current portion
= $10,912 + $85,750
= $96,662
